This repo contain the program for a <b>Line Following Robot</b> with output <b>Crystal Display</b> written in *Arduino C++*.<br/>
I made this in my first-sem of engineering when I started to learn programming. I didn't documented it properly at that time so sorry if you can't understand it properly as their are no comments in the code :weary:.<br/>
But guess what, it works :sunglasses:.<br/>
But definately I will try to include the instruction for connection in future.<br/>
Appreciate if you try to contribute :wink:.
